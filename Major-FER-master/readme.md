## What is FER or facial emotion recognition?

> It is the process of using computer algorithms to identify and analyze emotional states of a person by analyzing their facial expressions.

> FER technology is used in various fields such as psychology, neuroscience, marketing, and human-computer interaction to better understand the emotions and behaviors of individuals.

> The technology works by analyzing facial features such as eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, and cheeks to detect patterns of muscle movement that correspond to different emotions.

# Usage

1. To train the model use the following command

```sh
 python fer.py
```

2. The model can make predictions on saved images by providing the image path using the following command

```sh
 python img_predict.py img_name.png
```

2. It can also predict on saved videos

```sh
  python vid_predict.py vid_name.mp4
```

3. Or by using a live camera

```sh
  python live_cam_predict.py
```
